This was my final year B.Tech Project.
Most of the restaurants in India follow the traditional pen and paper method to take orders from customers, which wastes a lot of time of both, the customer and the restaurant. This work aims to substitute the traditional pen and paper method by automating the food-ordering process in restaurant and thus improving the dining experience of the customer. This paper proposes an automated system that uses wireless communication, a centralized database, and a web based application to place the order without even waiting for a waiter.
The web based application , contains all the menu details with pictures ofeach item. The ordered details are wirelessly sent to the chef and the cashier. The manager has his own web portal that is used to viewand manage table wise customersâ€™ orders, and receive feedbacks
from the customer. This system improves efficiency and accuracy for restaurants by saving time, eliminating human errors, getting
customers feedback. As the system is automated, it becomes economical even from restaurants point of view, as it reduces
manpower.
For the development of the project,I have simply used PHP, HTML, Javascript , SQL, BOOTSTRAP framework, CSS.
IT took around 3 months for the designing and development of this responsive website.
When hosted, can work on any screen size mobile device(like Laptops, android phone, tabs) which has access to the corresponding WIFI.
